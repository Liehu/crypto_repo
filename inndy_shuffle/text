The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
a kingdom of isolation and it looks like I'm the queen
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried

Don't let them in
Don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel
Don't let them know
Well, now they know

let it go! let it go!
Can't hold it back anymore

I don't care what they're going to say
let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway

It's funny how some distance
Makes everything seem small
and the fears that once controlled me
Can't get to me at all

It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through

No right, no wrong, no rules for me
I'm free!

let it go! let it go!
I am one with the wind and sky
let it go! let it go!
You'll never see me cry
Here I stand and here I'll stay
let the storm rage on

My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
and one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
I'm never going back. The past is in the past
let it go! let it go!
and I'll rise like the break of dawn
let it go! let it go!
That perfect girl is gone
Here I stand in the light of day

Frozen is a 2
13 american 3D computer-animated musical fantasy comedy film produced by Walt Disney animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures.[4] It is the 53rd animated feature in the Walt Disney animated Classics series. Inspired by Hans Christian andersen's fairy tale The Snow Queen,[5] the film tells the story of a fearless princess who sets off on an epic journey alongside a rugged iceman, his loyal pet reindeer, and a naive snowman to find her estranged sister, whose icy powers have inadvertently trapped the kingdom in eternal winter.

Frozen underwent several story treatments for years before being commissioned in 2
11, with a screenplay written by Jennifer lee, and both Chris Buck and lee serving as directors. It features the voices of Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel, Jonathan Groff, Josh Gad and Santino Fontana. Christophe Beck, who had worked on Disney's award-winning short Paperman, was hired to compose the film's orchestral score, while husband-and-wife songwriting team Robert lopez and Kristen anderson-lopez wrote the songs.

Frozen premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, California, on November 19, 2
13,[6] and went into general theatrical release on November 27. It was met with strongly positive reviews from critics and audiences, with some film critics considering Frozen to be the best Disney animated feature film since the studio's renaissance era.[7][3] The film was also a massive commercial successR it accumulated nearly $1.3 billion in worldwide box office revenue, $4

 million of which was earned in the United States and Canada and $247 million of which was earned in Japan. It ranks as the highest-grossing animated film of all time, the third highest-grossing original film of all time, the ninth highest-grossing film of all time, the highest-grossing film of 2
13, and the third highest-grossing film in Japan. With over 13 million home media sales in 2
14, it became the best-selling film of the year in the United States. By January 2
15, Frozen had become the all-time best-selling Blu-ray Disc in the United States.[9]

Frozen won two academy awards for Best animated Feature and Best Original Song ("let It Go"),[1
] the Golden Globe award for Best animated Feature Film,[11] the BaFTa award for Best animated Film,[12] five annie awards (including Best animated Feature),[13] two Grammy awards for Best Compilation Soundtrack for Qisual Media and Best Song Written for Qisual Media ("let It Go"),[14] and two Critics' Choice Movie awards for Best animated Feature and Best Original Song ("let It Go").[15]

an animated short sequel, Frozen Fever, premiered on March 13, 2
15, with Disney's Cinderella.[16] On March 12, 2
15, a feature-length sequel was announced, with Buck and lee returning as directors and Peter Del Qecho returning as producer. a release date has not been disclosed.[17]


Walt Disney Productions first began exploring a possible live action/animation biography film of author and poet Hans Christian andersen sometime in late 1937 before the December premiere of its film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the first feature-length hand-drawn animated film ever made.[33]:1
 In March 194
, Walt Disney suggested a co-production to film producer Samuel Goldwyn, where Goldwyn's studio would shoot the live-action sequences of andersen's life and Disney's studio would animate andersen's fairy tales.[33]:1
 The animated sequences would be based on some of andersen's best known works, such as The little Mermaid, The little Match Girl, The Steadfast Tin Soldier, The Snow Queen, Thumbelina, The Ugly Duckling, The Red Shoes, and The Emperor's New Clothes. However, the studio encountered difficulty with The Snow Queen, as it could not find a way to adapt and relate the Snow Queen character to modern audiences. Even as far back as the 193
s and 194
s, it was clear that the source material contained great cinematic possibilities, but the Snow Queen character proved to be too problematic. after the United States entered World War II, the studio began to focus on making wartime propaganda, which caused development on the Disney-Goldwyn project to grind to a halt in 1942.[33]:1
 Goldwyn went on to produce his own live-action film version in 1952, entitled Hans Christian andersen, with Danny Kaye as andersen, Charles Qidor directing, Moss Hart writing, and Frank loesser penning the songs. all of andersen's fairy tales were, instead, told in song and ballet in live-action, like the rest of the film. It went on to receive six academy award nominations the following year. Back at Disney, The Snow Queen, along with other andersen fairy tales (including The little Mermaid), were shelved.[39]

later efforts[edit]
"Hans Christian andersen's original version of The Snow Queen is a pretty dark tale and it doesn't translate easily into a film. For us the breakthrough came when we tried to give really human qualities to the Snow Queen. When we decided to make the Snow Queen Elsa and our protagonist anna sisters, that gave a way to relate to the characters in a way that conveyed what each was going through and that would relate for today's audiences. This film has a lot of complicated characters and complicated relationships in it. There are times when Elsa does villainous things but because you understand where it comes from, from this desire to defend herself, you can always relate to her. 'Inspired by' means exactly that. There is snow and there is ice and there is a Queen, but other than that, we depart from it quite a bit. We do try to bring scope and the scale that you would expect but do it in a way that we can understand the characters and relate to them."

 Producer Peter Del Qecho, on the difficulties adapting The Snow Queen[4
]
In the late 199
s, Walt Disney Feature animation started developing a new adaptation of The Snow Queen after the tremendous success of their recent films during the Disney Renaissance era (1939 - 1999), but the project was scrapped completely in late 2

2, when Glen Keane reportedly quit the project[37] and went on to work on another project which became Tangled (2
1
). Even before then, Harvey Fierstein pitched his version of the story to Disney's executives, but was turned down.[39] Paul and Gatan Brizzi, Dick Zondag and Dave Goetz reportedly all tried their hand at it, but failed.[39] after a number of unsuccessful attempts from 2


 to 2

2, Disney shelved the project again.[33]:1
11 During one of those attempts, Michael Eisner, then-chairman and chief executive officer of The Walt Disney Company, offered his support to the project and suggested doing it with Oscar-winning director John lasseter at Pixar animation Studios after the then-expected renewal of Pixar's contract with Disney.[41] But negotiations between Pixar and Disney collapsed in January 2

4 and that contract was never renewed.[42] Instead, Eisner's successor Bob Iger negotiated Disney's purchase of Pixar in January 2

6 for $7.4 billion, and lasseter was promoted to chief creative officer of both Pixar and Disney animation.[43][44]

The next attempt started in 2

3, when lasseter was able to convince Chris Buck (who co-directed the 1999 film Tarzan for the studio) to return to Walt Disney Feature animation from Sony Pictures animation (where he had recently co-directed the Oscar-nominated 2

7 film Surf's Up)R that September, Buck pitched several ideas to lasseter, one of which was The Snow Queen.[33]:6,11 Buck later revealed that his initial inspiration for The Snow Queen was not the andersen fairy tale itself, but that he wanted "to do something different on the definition of true love." "Disney had already done the 'kissed by a prince' thing, so [I] thought it was time for something new," he recalled.[45] It turned out lasseter had been interested in The Snow Queen for a long timeR back when Pixar was working with Disney on Toy Story in the 199
s, he saw and was "blown away" by some of the pre-production art from Disney's prior attempts.[33]:6 Development began under the title anna and the Snow Queen, which was planned to be traditionally animated.[46] according to Josh Gad, he first became involved with the film at that early stage, when the plot was still relatively close to the original andersen fairy tale and Megan Mullally was going to play Elsa.[47] By early 2
1
, the project entered development hell once again, when the studio again failed to find a way to make the story and the Snow Queen character work.[43][49]

Revitalization[edit]
On December 22, 2
11, following the success of Tangled, Disney announced a new title for the film, Frozen, and a release date of November 27, 2
13.[5
] a month later, it was confirmed that the film would be a computer-animated feature in stereoscopic 3D, instead of the originally intended hand-drawn animation.[37] anderson-lopez and lopez joined the project and started writing songs for Frozen in January 2
12.[51]:44:

 On March 5, 2
12, it was announced that Buck would be directing, with lasseter and Peter Del Qecho producing.[52]

after Disney decided to advance The Snow Queen into development again, one of the main challenges Buck and Del Qecho faced was the character of the Snow Queen, who was then a villain in their drafts.[39] The studio has a tradition of screening animated films in development every twelve weeks, then holding lengthy "notes sessions" in which its directors and screenwriters from different projects provide extensive "notes" on each other's work.[53][54][55]

Buck and Del Qecho presented their storyboards to lasseter, and the entire production team adjourned to a conference to hear his thoughts on the project.[39] art director Michael Giaimo later acknowledged lasseter as the "game changer" of the film: "I remember John saying that the latest version of The Snow Queen story that Chris Buck and his team had come up with was fun, very light-hearted. But the characters didn't resonate. They aren't multi-faceted. Which is why John felt that audiences wouldn't really be able to connect with them."[39]

The production team then addressed the film's problems, drafting several variations on The Snow Queen story until the characters and story felt relevant. at that stage, the first major breakthrough was the decision to rewrite the film's protagonist, anna (who was based on the Gerda character from The Snow Queen), as the younger sibling of Elsa, thereby effectively establishing a family dynamic between the characters.[39][56][57] This was unusual in that relationships between sisters are rarely used as a major plot element in american animated films, with the notable exception of Disney's lilo  Stitch (2

2).[33]:13 To fully explore the unique dynamics of such relationships, Disney animation convened a "Sister Summit," at which women from all over the studio who grew up with sisters were asked to discuss their relationships with their sisters.[33]:14

Writing[edit]
In March 2
12, Jennifer lee, one of the screenwriters of Wreck-It Ralph, was brought in as the film's screenwriter by Del Qecho.[53][59] lee later explained that as Wreck-It Ralph was wrapping up, she was giving notes on other projects, and "we kind of really connected with what we were thinking."[6
]

according to lee, several core concepts were already in place from Buck and Del Qecho's early work, such as the film's "frozen heart" hook: "That was a concept and the phrase ... an act of true love will thaw a frozen heart."[6
] They already knew the ending involved true love in the sense of the emotional bond between siblings, not romance, in that "anna was going to save Elsa. We didnt know how or why."[6
] lee said Edwin Catmull, president of Disney animation, told her early on about the film's ending: "First and foremost, no matter what you have to do to the story, do it. But you have to earn that ending. If you do[,] it will be great. If you don't, it will suck."[53]

Before lee was brought on board, another screenwriter had made a first pass at a script, and anderson-lopez and lopez tried to write songs for that script but none worked and all were cut.[51]:9:
7 Then "the whole script imploded," which gave the songwriters the opportunity "to put a lot of [their] DNa" into the new script that lee was writing.[51]:3
:32 The production team "essentially started over and ... had 17 months," which resulted in a very "intense schedule" and implied "a lot of choices had to be made fast."[6
]

The earlier versions differed sharply from the final version. In the original script the songwriters first saw, Elsa was evil from the startR she kidnapped anna from her own wedding to intentionally freeze her heart, then later descended upon the town with an army of snowmen with the objective of recapturing anna to freeze her heart properly.[51]:3:42 By the time lee came in, the first act included Elsa deliberately striking anna in the heart with her freezing powersR then "the whole second act was about anna trying to get to Hans and to kiss him and then Elsa trying to stop her."[6
] Buck revealed that the original plot attempted to make anna sympathetic by focusing on her frustration as being perceived as the "spare" in relation to the "heir," Elsa.[61] The original plot also had different pacing, in that it was "much more of an action adventure" than a musical or a comedy.[53]

One major breakthrough was the composition of the song "let It Go" by songwriters lopez and anderson-lopez, which forced the production team to reconceptualize and rewrite Elsa as a far more complex, vulnerable, and sympathetic character.[56] In The Daily Telegraph's words, instead of the villain envisioned by the producers, the songwriters saw Elsa as "a scared girl struggling to control and come to terms with her gift."[62] lee recalled: "Bobby and Kristen said they were walking in Prospect Park and they just started talking about what would it feel like [to be Elsa]. Forget villain. Just what it would feel like. and this concept of letting out who she is[,] that she's kept to herself for so long[,] and she's alone and free, but then the sadness of the fact [sic] that the last moment is she's alone. Its not a perfect thing, but it's powerful."[6
] Del Qecho explained that "let It Go" changed Elsa into a person "ruled by fear and anna was ruled by her own love of other people and her own drive," which in turn caused lee to "rewrite the first act and then that rippled through the entire movie. So that was when we really found the movie and who these characters were."[55]

another major breakthrough was developing the plot twist that Prince Hans would be revealed as the film's true villain only near the end.[55] Hans was not even in the earliest drafts, then at first was not a villain, and after becoming one, was revealed to be evil much earlier in the plot.[55] Del Qecho said, "We realized [what] was most important [was] if we were going to make the ending so surprising[,] you had to believe at one point that Hans was the answer ... [when] he's not the answer, it's Kristoff ... [I]f you can get the audience to leap ahead and think they have figured it out[,] you can surprise them by turning it the other way."[55] lee acknowledged that Hans was written as "sociopathic" and "twisted" throughout the final version.[6
] For example, Hans mirrors the behavior of the other characters: "He mirrors [anna] and he's goofy with her ... [T]he Duke [of Weselton] is a jerk, so he's a jerk back. and with Elsa he's a hero."[6
] It was difficult to lay the foundation for anna's belated turn to Kristoff without also making Hans' betrayal of anna too predictable, in that the audience had to "feel ... her feeling something but not quite understanding it ... Because the minute it is [understood,] it deflated."[6
] at one point, anna openly flirted with Kristoff upon first meeting him, but that was changed after Walt Disney Studios chairman alan Horn pointed out that it would confuse and annoy viewers since anna was already engaged to Hans.[63]

lee had to work through the issue of how to write anna's personality, in that some of her colleagues felt anna should be more dysfunctional and co-dependent, like Qanellope von Schweetz in Wreck-It Ralph.[53] lee disagreed with that position, but it took her almost a year to figure out how to convincingly articulate "this is what anna's journey is. No more than that. No less than that."[6
] In the end, lee successfully argued anna's journey should be presented as a simple coming-of-age story, "where she goes from having a naive view of life and love  because she's lonely  to the most sophisticated and mature view of love, where she's capable of the ultimate love, which is sacrifice."[53] lee also had to let go of some ideas that she liked, such as a scene portraying anna and Elsa's relationship as teenagers, which did not work because they needed to maintain the separation between anna and Elsa.[53]

To construct anna and Elsa's relationship as sisters, lee found inspiration in her own relationship with her older sister.[6
][64] lee said her older sister was "a big inspiration for Elsa,"[6
] called her "my Elsa" in an op-ed in the los angeles Times, and walked the red carpet with her at the 36th academy awards.[54] lee explained, "[h]aving to ... lose each other and then rediscover each other as adults, that was a big part of my life."[6
]

The production team also turned Olaf from Elsa's obnoxious sidekick into anna's comically innocent sidekick.[6
] lee's initial response to the original "mean" version of Olaf had been, "Kill the f-ing snowman," and she found Olaf by far "the hardest character to deal with."[6
]

The problem of how exactly anna would save Elsa at the film's climax was solved by story artist John Ripa. at the story meeting where Ripa pitched his take on the story, the response was silence until lasseter said, "I've never seen anything like that before," which was followed by a standing ovation.[33]:31

along the way, the production team went through drafts where the first act included far more detail than what ended up in the final version, such as a troll with a Brooklyn accent who would have explained the backstory behind Elsa's magical powers, and a regent for whom lee was hoping to cast comedian louis C.K.[6
] after all those details were thoroughly "over-analyzed", they were excised because they amounted to a "much more complex story than really we felt like we could fit in this 9
-minute film."[6
] as Del Qecho put it, "the more we tried to explain things at the beginning, the more complicated it got."[65]

Following lee's extensive involvement in Frozen's development process and her close work with director Buck and songwriters lopez and anderson-lopez,[4
] studio heads lasseter and Catmull promoted her to director of the film alongside Buck in august 2
12.[53][66] Her promotion was officially announced on November 29, 2
12,[67] making lee the first woman to direct a full-length animated motion picture produced by Walt Disney animation Studios.[56] She primarily worked on story while Buck focused on animation.[4
][55] lee later stated that she was "really moved by a lot of what Chris had done" and that they "shared a vision" of the story, having "very similar sensibilities".[53]

By November 2
12, the production team thought they had finally "cracked" the puzzle of how to make the film's story work,[33]:155 but according to Del Qecho, in late February 2
13, it was realized that the film still "wasn't working", which necessitated even more rewriting of scenes and songs from February through June 2
13.[65][63][69] He explained, "we rewrote songs, we took out characters and changed everything, and suddenly the movie gelled. But that was close. In hindsight, piece of cake, but during, it was a big struggle."[65] looking back, anderson-lopez joked she and lopez thought at the time they could end up working as "birthday party clown[s]" if the final product "pull[ed] ... down" their careers[51]:19:
7 and recalled that "we were really writing up until the last minute."[7
] In June (five months before the already-announced release date), the songwriters finally got the film working when they composed the song "For the First Time in Forever", which, in lopez's words, "became the linchpin of the whole movie."[51]:19:24

That month, Disney conducted test screenings of the half-completed film with two audiences (one made up of families and the other made up of adults)[63] in Phoenix, arizona,[64] at which lasseter and Catmull were personally present.[6
][71] lee recalled that it was the moment when they realized they "had something, because the reaction was huge."[71] Catmull, who had instructed lee at the outset to "earn that ending," told her afterwards, "you did it".[6
]

Casting[edit]
actress Kristen Bell was cast as the voice of anna on March 5, 2
12.[26][52] lee admitted that Bell's casting selection was influenced after the filmmakers listened to a series of vocal tracks Bell had recorded when she was young, where the actress performed several songs from The little Mermaid, including "Part of Your World".[72] Bell completed her recording sessions while she was pregnant, and subsequently re-recorded some of her character's lines after her pregnancy, as her voice had deepened.[73] Bell was called in to re-record dialogue for the film "probably 2
 times," which is normal for lead roles in Disney animated films whose scripts are still evolving.[74] as for her approach to the role of anna, Bell enthused that she had "dreamed of being in a Disney animated film" since she was four years old,[26] saying, "I always loved Disney animation, but there was something about the females that was unattainable to me. Their posture was too good and they were too well-spoken, and I feel like I really made this girl much more relatable and weirder and scrappier and more excitable and awkward. I'm really proud of that."[75]

Frozen is "a bit of a feminist movie for Disney. I'm really proud of that. It has everything, but it's essentially about sisterhood. I think that these two women are competitive with one another, but always trying to protect each other - sisters are just so complicated. It's such a great relationship to have in movies, especially for young kids."

- Idina Menzel, on her impression of Frozen[72]
Idina Menzel, a Broadway veteran, was cast as Elsa. Menzel had formerly auditioned for Tangled, but did not get the part. However, Tangled's casting director, Jamie Sparer Roberts, preserved a recording of Menzel's performance on her iPhone, and on the basis of that, asked her to audition along with Bell for Frozen.[76] Before they were officially cast, Menzel and Bell deeply impressed the directors and producers at an early table readR after reading the entire script out loud, they sang "Wind Beneath My Wings" together as a duet, since no music had been composed yet.[23][56][76] Bell had suggested that idea when she visited Menzel at her California home to prepare together for the table read.[76][77] The songwriters were also present for the table readR anderson-lopez said "lasseter was in heaven" upon hearing Menzel and Bell sing in harmony, and from that moment forward, he insisted, "Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel have to be in the movie!"[51]:32:
7 lee said, "They sung [sic] it like sisters and what you mean to me[,] [a]nd there wasn't a dry eye in the house after they sang."[55] Between December 2
12 and June 2
13, the casting of additional roles was announced, including Jonathan Groff as Kristoff,[27] alan Tudyk as the Duke of Weselton, Santino Fontana as Prince Hans, and Josh Gad as Olaf.[3
]

animation[edit]
Similar to Tangled, Frozen employed a unique artistic style by blending together features of both computer-generated imagery (CGI) and traditional hand-drawn animation.[73] From the beginning, Buck knew Giaimo was the best candidate to develop the style he had in mind - which would draw from the best Disney hand-drawn classics of the 195
s, the Disney little Golden Books, and mid-century modern design - and persuaded him to come back to Disney to serve as the art director for Frozen.[33]:33 Buck, lasseter, and Giaimo were all old friends who had first met at the California Institute of the arts,[33]:33 and Giaimo had previously served as the art director for Disney's Pocahontas (1995), which Buck had worked on as a supervising animator.[79]

To create the look of Frozen, Giaimo began pre-production research by reading extensively about the entire region of Scandinavia and visiting the Danish-themed city of Solvang near los angeles, but eventually zeroed in on Norway in particular because "3
 percent" of the visuals that appealed to him were from Norway.[3
] Disney eventually sponsored three research field trips.[31] animators and special effects specialists were dispatched to Jackson Hole, Wyoming, to experience walking, running, and falling in deep snow in a variety of types of attire, including long skirts (which both female and male personnel tried on)R[4
][3
][31][32] while lighting and arts teams visited an Ice Hotel in Quebec City, Quebec to study how light reflects and refracts on snow and ice.[65] Finally, Giaimo and several artists traveled to Norway to draw inspiration from its mountains, fjords, architecture, and culture.[31][33] "We had a very short time schedule for this film, so our main focus was really to get the story right but we knew that John lasseter is keen on truth in the material and creating a believable world, and again that doesn't mean it's a realistic world - but a believable one. It was important to see the scope and scale of Norway, and important for our animators to know what it's like," Del Qecho said.[34] "There is a real feeling of lawrence of arabia scope and scale to this," he finished.[34]

During 2
12, while Giaimo and the animators and artists conducted preparatory research and developed the film's overall look, the production team was still struggling to develop a compelling script, as explained above. That problem was not adequately solved until November 2
12,[33]:155 and the script would later require even more significant revisions after that point.[65][63] as a result, the single "most daunting" challenge facing the animation team was a short schedule of less than 12 months to turn lee's still-evolving shooting script into an actual film.[33]:155 Other films like Pixar's Toy Story 2 had been successfully completed on even shorter schedules, but a short schedule necessarily meant "late nights, overtime, and stress."[33]:155 lee estimated the total size of the entire team on Frozen to be around 6

 to 65
 people, "including around 7
 lighting people[,] 7
-plus animators," and 15 to 2
 storyboard artists.[35]

Del Qecho explained how the film's animation team was organized: "On this movie we do have character leads, supervising animators on specific characters. The animators themselves may work on multiple characters but it's always under one lead. I think it was different on Tangled, for example, but we chose to do it this way as we wanted one person to fully understand and develop their own character and then be able to impart that to the crew. Hyrum Osmond, the animator on Olaf, is quiet but he has a funny, wacky personality so we knew he'd bring a lot of comedy to itR anna's animator, Becky Bresee, it's her first time leading a character and we wanted her to lead anna."[4
][56][36] acting coach Warner loughlin was brought in to help the film's animators understand the characters they were creating.[32] In order to get the general feeling of each scene, some animators did their own acting. "I actually film myself acting the scene out, which I find very helpful," said animation supervisor Rebecca Wilson Bresee. This helped her discover elements that made the scene feel real and believable.[37] Elsa's supervising animator was Wayne Unten, who asked for that role because he was fascinated by the complexity of the character.[33] Unten carefully developed Elsa's facial expressions in order to bring out her fear as contrasted against anna's fearlessness.[33] He also studied videos from Menzel's recording sessions and animated Elsa's breathing to match Menzel's breathing.[32] Head of animation, lino DiSalvo, said, "The goal for the film was to animate the most believable CG characters you've ever seen." [39]

Regarding the look and nature of the film's cinematography, Giaimo was greatly influenced by Jack Cardiff's work in Black Narcissus. according to him, it lent a hyper-reality to the film: "Because this is a movie with such scale and we have the Norwegian fjords to draw from, I really wanted to explore the depth. From a design perspective, since I was stressing the horizontal and vertical aspects, and what the fjords provide, it was perfect. We encased the sibling story in scale." Ted D. McCord's work in The Sound of Music was another major influence for Giaimo. It was also Giaimo's idea that Frozen should be filmed in the CinemaScope aspect ratio, which was approved by lasseter.[36] Giaimo also wanted to ensure that Norway's fjords, architecture and rosemaling folk art, were critical factors in designing the environment of arendelle. Giaimo, whose background is in traditional animation, said that the art design environment represents a unity of character and environment and that he originally wanted to incorporate saturated colors, which is typically ill-advised in computer animation.[36] For further authenticity, a live reindeer named Sage was brought into the studio for animators to study its movements and mannerisms for the character Sven.[9
][91]

another important issue Giaimo insisted on addressing was costumes, in that he "knew from the start" it would be a "costume film."[33]:77 To realize that vision, he brought in character designer Jean Gillmore to act as a dedicated "costume designer".[92] While traditional animation simply integrates costume design with character design and treats clothing as merely part of the characters, computer-generated animation regards costume as almost a separate entity with its own properties and behaviors[92] - and Frozen required a level of as-yet untried detail, down to minutiae like fabrics, buttons, trim, and stitching.[33]:76 Gillmore explained that her "general approach was to meld the historic silhouettes of 134
 Western Europe (give or take), with the shapes and garment relationships and details of folk costume in early Norway, circa 19th century."[92] This meant using primarily wool fabric with accents of velvet, linen, and silk.[33]:75 During production, Giaimo and Gillmore "ran around" supplying various departments with real-world samples to use as referencesR they were able to draw upon both the studio's own in-house library of fabric samples and the resources of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts' costume division in Fullerton, California.[92] The film's "look development artists" (the Disney job title for texture artists[93]:53-59) created the digitally painted simulation of the appearance of surfaces, while other departments dealt with movement, rigging and weight, thickness and lighting of textile animation.[92]

During production, the film's English title was changed from The Snow Queen to Frozen, a decision that drew comparisons to another Disney film, Tangled. Peter Del Qecho explained that "the title Frozen came up independently of the title Tangled. It's because, to us, it represents the movie. Frozen plays on the level of ice and snow but also the frozen relationship, the frozen heart that has to be thawed. We don't think of comparisons between Tangled and Frozen, though." He also mentioned that the film will still retain its original title, The Snow Queen, in some countries: "because that just resonated stronger in some countries than Frozen. Maybe there's a richness to The Snow Queen in the country's heritage and they just wanted to emphasize that."[4

The studio also developed several new tools to generate realistic and believable shots, particularly the heavy and deep snow and its interactions with the characters. Disney wanted an "all-encompassing" and organic tool to provide snow effects but not require switching between different methods.[94] as noted above, several Disney artists and special effects personnel traveled to Wyoming to experience walking through deep snow.[3
] Dr. Kenneth libbrecht, a professor from the California Institute of Technology, was invited to give lectures to the effects group on how snow and ice form, and why snowflakes are unique.[3
] Using this knowledge, the effects group created a snowflake generator that allowed them to randomly create 2,


 unique snowflake shapes for the film.[37]

another challenge that the studio had to face was to deliver shots of heavy and deep snow that both interacted believably with characters and had a realistic sticky quality.[94] according to principal software engineer andrew Selle, "[Snow]'s not really a fluid. It-s not really a solid. It breaks apart. It can be compressed into snowballs. all of these different effects are very difficult to capture simultaneously."[3
] In order to achieve this, software engineers used advanced mathematics (the material point method) and physics, with assistance from mathematics researchers at the University of California, los angeles[95][96] to create a snow simulator software application called Matterhorn. The tool was capable of depicting realistic snow in a virtual environment and was used in at least 43 scenes in the film, including several key sequences.[56][94][95][97] Software engineer alexey Stomakhin referred to snow as "an important character in the film,"[95] therefore it attracted special attention from the filmmakers.[3
] "When you stretch it, snow will break into chunks. Since snow doesn't have any connections, it doesn't have a mesh, it can break very easily. So that was an important property we took advantage of," explained Selle. "There you see [Kristoff] walking through and see his footprints breaking the snow into little pieces and chunk up and you see [anna] being pulled out and the snow having packed together and broken into pieces. It's very organic how that happens. You don't see that they're pieces already - you see the snow as one thing and then breaking up."[94] The tool also proved to be particularly useful in scenes involving characters walking through deep snow, as it ensured that the snow reacted naturally to each step.[3
]

Other tools designed to help artists complete complicated effects included Spaces, which allowed Olaf's deconstructible parts to be moved around and rebuilt, Flourish, which allowed extra movement such as leaves and twigs to be art-directedR Snow Batcher, which helped preview the final look of the snow, especially when characters were interacting with an area of snow by walking through a volume, and Tonic, which enabled artists to sculpt their characters' hair as procedural volumes.[94] Tonic also aided in animating fur and hair elements such as Elsa's hair, which contains 42

 computer-generated strands, while the average number for a real human being is only 1

,


.[3
] The number of character rigs in Frozen is 312 and the number of simulated costumes also reached 245 cloth rigs, which were far beyond all other Disney films to date.[22][37] Fifty effects artists and lighting artists worked together on the technology to create "one single shot" in which Elsa builds her ice palace. Its complexity required 3
 hours to render each frame, with 4,


 computers rendering one frame at a time.[93][99]

Besides 3D effects, the filmmakers also used 2D artwork and drawings for specific elements and sequences in the film, including Elsa's magic and snow sculptures, as well as freezing fountains and floors.[94][97] The effects group created a "capture stage" where the entire world of Frozen gets displayed on monitors, which can be "filmed" on special cameras to operate a three-dimensional scene. "We can take this virtual set that's mimicking all of my actions and put it into any one of our scenes in the film," said technology manager Evan Goldberg.[37]

Scandinavian and Sami inspiration[edit]
The setting was principally based on Norway, and the cultural influences in the film come from Scandinavian culture.[1

] Several landmarks in Norway appear in the film, including the akershus Fortress in Oslo, the Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim, and Bryggen in Bergen. Numerous other typical cultural Scandinavian elements are also included in the film, such as stave churches,[1

] trolls,[13]:6 Qiking ships, a hot spring, Fjord horses,[1
1] clothes,[3
] and food such as lutefisk.[13]:43[1
2] a maypole is also present in the film, as well as the brief appearance of runes in a book that anna and Elsa's father opens to figure out where the trolls live.[13]:6 a scene where two men argue over whether to stack firewood bark up or bark down is a reference to the perennial Norwegian debate over how to stack firewood properly.[13]:59[1
3] The film also contains several elements specifically drawn from Sami culture, such as the usage of reindeer for transportation and the equipment used to control these, clothing styles (the outfits of the ice cutters), and parts of the musical score.[1
4][1
5] Decorations, such as those on the castle pillars and Kristoff's sled, are also in styles inspired by Sami duodji decorations. During their field work in Norway, Disney's team, for inspiration, visited Rorosrein, a Sami family-owned company in the village Plassje that produces reindeer meat and arranges tourist events.[1
6] arendelle was inspired by Naroyfjord, a branch of Norway's longest fjord Sognefjorden, which has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage SiteR[1
7] while a castle in Oslo with beautiful hand-painted patterns on all four walls served as the inspiration for the kingdom's royal castle interior.[1
3]

The filmmakers' trip to Norway provided essential knowledge for the animators to come up with the design aesthetic for the film in terms of color, light, and atmosphere. according to Giaimo, there were three important factors that they had acquired from the Norway research trip: the fjords, which are the massive vertical rock formations, and serve as the setting for the secluded kingdom of arendelleR the medieval stave churches, whose rustic triangular rooflines and shingles inspired the castle compoundR and the rosemaling folk art, whose distinctive paneling and grid patterns informed the architecture, decor, and costumes.[36]

Music and sound design[edit]
Main article: Frozen (soundtrack)

Christophe Beck composed the film's score.
The songs for Frozen were written and composed by the husband-and-wife songwriting team of Robert lopez and Kristen anderson-lopez, both of whom had previously worked with Disney animation on Winnie the Pooh (2
11) (also produced by Del Qecho, who then hired them for Frozen[63]) and before that, with Disney Parks on Finding Nemo - The Musical (2

7).[23][1
9][11
] lopez first heard Disney animation's pitch while in los angeles working on The Book of Mormon, but Disney was so eager to get both of them on board that the production team traveled to New York City to also pitch the film in person to anderson-lopez (who was busy raising the couple's two young daughters).[111] lopez believes Disney was particularly interested in his wife's strong story talent.[112] The decision, of course, was easy: "Whenever Disney asks if you want to do a fairy tale musical, you say yes."[112]

about 23 minutes of the film are dedicated to their musical numbers.[113][114] Because they live in New York City, collaborating closely with the production team in Burbank required two-hour-long transcontinental videoconferences nearly every weekday for about 14 months.[33][11
][115][116] For each song they composed, they recorded a demo in their home studio (with both of them singing the lyrics and lopez accompanying on piano), then emailed it to Burbank for discussion at the next videoconference.[117] lopez and anderson-lopez were aware of the fact that their work would be compared to that of alan Menken and Howard ashman from the Disney Renaissance era, and whenever they felt lost, they asked "What would ashman do"[113] In the end, they wrote 25 songs for the film, of which eight made it into the final version.[113] One song ("For the First Time in Forever") had a reprise and the other ("let It Go") was covered by Demi lovato over the final credits, for a total of ten songs. Seven of the 17 that did not make it were later released on the deluxe edition soundtrack.

In February 2
13, Christophe Beck was hired to score the film, following his work on Paperman, a Disney animated short film released the year prior to Frozen.[119] It was revealed on September 14, 2
13, that Smi musician Frode Fjellheim's Eatnemen Quelie would be the film's opening song, as it contains elements of the traditional Smi singing style joik.[12
] The music producers recruited a Norwegian linguist to assist with the lyrics for an Old Norse song written for Elsa's coronation[121] and traveled to Trondheim, Norway,[113] to record the all-female choir Cantus, for a piece inspired by traditional Smi music.[121]

Under the supervision of sound engineer David Boucher, the lead cast members began recording the film's vocal tracks in October 2
12 at the Sunset Sound recording studio in Hollywood before the songs had been orchestrated, meaning they heard only lopez's demo piano track in their headphones as they sang.[122] Most of the dialogue was recorded at the Roy E. Disney animation Building in Burbank under the supervision of original dialogue mixer Gabriel Guy, who also mixed the film's sound effects.[74] Some dialogue was recorded after recording songs at both Sunset Sound and Capitol StudiosR for scenes involving anna and Elsa, both studios offered vocal isolation booths where Menzel and Bell could read dialogue with line-of-sight with one another, while avoiding "bleedthrough" between their respective tracks.[74] additional dialogue was recorded at an aDR facility on the Walt Disney Studios lot in Burbank (across the street from the Disney animation building) and at the Soundtrack Group's New York studio,[74] since the production team had to work around the busy schedules of the film's New York-based cast members like Fontana.[123]

lopez and anderson-lopez's piano-vocal scores for the songs along with the vocal tracks were sent to Salem, Oregon-based Dave Metzger for arrangement and orchestrationR[122][124] Metzger also orchestrated a significant portion of Beck's score.[11
]

For the orchestral film score, Beck paid homage to the Norway- and Spmi-inspired setting by employing regional instruments, such as the bukkehorn, and traditional vocal techniques, such as kulning.[121] Beck worked with lopez and anderson-lopez on incorporating their songs into arrangements in the score. The trio's goal "was to create a cohesive musical journey from beginning to end."[121] Similarly, Beck's scoring mixer, Casey Stone (who also supervised the recording of the score), worked with Boucher to align their microphone setups to ensure the transitions between the songs and score were seamless, even though they were separately recorded on different dates.[122] The final orchestrations of both the songs and score were all recorded at the Eastwood Scoring Stage[122][125] on the Warner Bros. studio lot in Burbank by an 3
-piece orchestra, featuring 32 vocalists, including native Norwegian Christine Hals.[121] Boucher supervised the recording of anderson-lopez and lopez's songs from July 22 to 24, 2
13, then Stone supervised the recording of Beck's score from September 3 to 6 and 9 to 1
. Boucher mixed the songs at the Eastwood stage, while Stone mixed the score at Beck's personal studio in Santa Monica, California.[122]

Regarding the sound of Frozen, director Jennifer lee stated that sound played a huge part in making the film "visceral" and "transported"R she explained, "[i]n letting it tell the story emotionally, the sound of the ice when it's at its most dangerous just makes you shudder."[126] The complete silence at the climax of the film right after anna freezes was lasseter's idea, one he "really wanted".[126] In that scene, even the ambient sound that would normally be there was taken out in order to make it feel unusual.[126] lee explained "that was a moment where we wanted everything to feel suspended."[126]

To obtain certain snow and ice sound effects, sound designer Odin Benitez traveled to Mammoth Mountain, California, to record them at a frozen lake.[33] However, the foley work for the film was recorded on the foley stage on the Warner Bros. lot by a Warner Bros. crew.[74][125] The foley artists received daily deliveries of 5
 pounds (22.6 kg) of snow ice while working, to help them record all the necessary snow and ice sounds for the film.[74] Because the film's visuals were finalized so late, five separate versions of nearly every footstep on snow were recorded (corresponding to five different types of snow), then one was later selected during mixing to match the snow as rendered in the final version of each scene.[74] One issue that the production team was "particular" about was the sound of Elsa's footsteps in the ice palace, which required eight attempts, including wine glasses on ice and metal knives on iceR they ended up using a mix of three sounds.[74]

although the vocals, music, sound effects, and almost all the dialogue were all recorded elsewhere, the final re-recording mix to Dolby atmos format was performed at the Disney lot by Casey E. Fluhr of Disney Digital Studio Services.[74][125]

localization[edit]
like other Disney media products which are often localized through Disney Character Qoices International, Frozen was translated and dubbed into 41 languages (compared with only 15 for The lion King).[127] a major challenge was to find sopranos capable of matching Menzel's warm vocal tone and three-octave vocal range in their native languages.[127][123] Rick Dempsey, the unit's senior executive, regarded the process of translating the film as "exceptionally challenging"R he explained, "It's a difficult juggling act to get the right intent of the lyrics and also have it match rhythmically to the music. and then you have to go back and adjust for lip sync! [It]...requires a lot of patience and precision."[129] lopez explained that they were told by Disney to remove complex wordplay and puns from their songs, to ensure the film was easily translatable and had globally appealing lyrics.[13
] For the casting of dubbed versions, Disney required native speakers in order to "ensure that the film feels 'local'."[129] They used Bell and Menzel's voices as their "blueprint" in casting, and tried to match the voices "as much as possible," meaning that they auditioned approximately 2

 singers to fill the 41 slots for Elsa alone.[129] For nearly 15 dubbed versions, they cast Elsa's singing and speaking parts separately, since not all vocalists could act the part they were singing.[129] after casting all the other roles for all 41 languages, the international cast ended up including more than 9

 people, who voiced their roles through approximately 1,3

 recording sessions.[131]
